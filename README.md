  Over the weekend, I wanted to do a deploy a simple EC2 instance into AWS with Terraform. Even with performing more complicated tasks, this task even proves that I have to step back and this with the fundementals of networking. Taking the time out doing this I was able to delete old access keys and generate new ones, installing AWS CLI on my new local user account, and configure the aws to be access via CLI and so forth. I strived my best to spend as much time in the CLI to build my strength within that. I enjoyed having a real world issue to solve in this task because I discussed my approach and how I resolved it by simply applying the "stop, look, and listen" approach. With all of that said, click over to the steps and check how I went about it.
